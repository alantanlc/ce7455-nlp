# CE7455: Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing: From Theory to Practice

## Course Objectives
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is one of the the most important fields in Artificial Intelligence (AI). It has become very crucial in the information age because most of the information is in the form of unstructured text. NLP technologies are applied everywhere as people communicate mostly in language: language translation, web search, customer support, emails, forums, advertisement, radiology reports, to name a few.

There are a number of core NLP tasks and machine learning models behind NLP applications. Deep learning, a sub-field of machine learning, has recently brought a paradigm shift from traditional task-soecific feature engineering to end-to-end systems and has obtained high performance across many different NLP tasks and downstream applications. Tech companies like Google, Baidu, Alibaba, Apple Amazon, Facebook, Tencent, and Microsoft are now actively working on deep learning methods to improve their products. For example, Google recently replaced its traditional statistical machine translation and speech-recognition systems with systems based on deep learning methods.

## Intended Learning Outcome
In this course, students will learn state-of-the-art deep learning methods for NLP. Through lectures and practical assignments, students will learn the necessary tricks for making their models work on practical problems. They will learn to implement, and possibly to invent their own deep learning models using available deep learning libraries like [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/).

### Our Approach
- _Thorough and Detailed_: How to write from scratch, debug and train deep neural models
- _State of the art_: Most lecture materials are new from research world in the past 1-5 years.
- _Practical_: Focus on practical techniques for training the models, and on GPUs.
- _Fun_: Cover exciting new advancements in NLP (e.g., Transformer, BERT).

## Assessment Approach
### Weekly Workload
- Every two-hour lecture will be accompanied by practice problems implemented in PyTorch.
- There will be a 30-min office per week to discuss assignments and project.
- There will be `5%` marks for class participation.

### Assignments (individually graded)
- There will be three (3) assignments contributing to `3 * 15% = 45%` of the total assessment.
- Late day policy
  - 2 free late days; afterwards, `10%` off per day late
  - Not accepted after 3 late days
- Students will be graded individually on the assignments. They will be allowed to discuss with each other on the homework assignments, but they are required to submit individual write-ups and coding exercises.

### Final Project (Group work but individually graded)
- There will be a final project contributing to the remaining 50% of the total course-work assessment.
  - `1-3` people per group
  - Project proposal: `5%`, updated: `5%`, presentation: `10%`, report: `30%`
- The project will be a group or individual work depending on the student's preference. Students will be graded individually. The final project presentation will ensure the student's understanding of the project
